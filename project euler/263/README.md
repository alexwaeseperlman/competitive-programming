# Project Euler #263
Problem statement: [https://projecteuler.net/problem=263](https://projecteuler.net/problem=263)

This was my first 75% difficulty problem, but it sort of feels like I cheated because of how brute-forcey this solution is. I started by doing some testing to see how common practical numbers are. It turns out there are a lot of them. Because of this I decided to cut down on the numbers being tested by using a sieve of erastosthenes to find triple-pairs, which are much less common. The limit for this sieve was set to 2 billion because it turns out that these numbers are quite large. I initially used a sieve to test for practical numbers, but this sieve runs in O(n log n) time, instead of the O(n log log n) of the sieve or erastosthenes, and it would have used around 8 gigabytes of ram (the sieve of erastosthenes used 250 megabytes because each value is one bit in a `vector<bool>`). It turns out that trial division was fast enough for finding practical numbers. I just made sure to avoid carrying that process out unnecessarily by filtering for triple pairs first.
