# Project Euler #23

Problem statement here: https://projecteuler.net/problem=23

This is definitely a brute force solution but it runs in about a quarter of a second so it's fine. I simply generate a list of every abundant number from 1-30000, and then test each number from 1-30000 to see if they can be made from numbers in this list.
